Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
	City = ‘Montreal’ - Category = ‘Business Consulting’

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

No

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

NO 
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Location data inconclusive as related to how a business is rated 

SQL code used for analysis:

		SELECT *
		FROM business 
		WHERE CITY like '%Montreal%'
		GROUP BY stars
		ORDER BY stars DESC

		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
Type of business (based on name)          
         
ii. Difference 2:
Location (based on city)        
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT name, city, stars, review_count, is_open
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open
ORDER BY stars DESC
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
view of table business and review

ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
i choose a all view of table business and review to see the link of primary key and second key to mix in one Data links
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
